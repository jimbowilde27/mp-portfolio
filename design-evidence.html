            <h3>Typography</h3>
            <p>The fonts I used on my website portray themes and moods I want communicated throughout. The font throughout the titles on all my linked pages were the same as I wanted to have consistency over the whole website. When considering typography and fonts I wanted to be inclusive for all, so I decided to include ‘ALT’ text for impaired viewers vision and experience expanding the experience to a wider variety of people. “Alternative text is something that makes the Internet inclusive and considerate. It’s like killing two birds with one stone”. This is imperative alongside fonts I have used, the fonts are bold to attract viewer’s attention where needed in the title as to lure them to reading on. The title is bolder text to establish the focus of the website whereas the rest of the text is a smaller font to allow detail into my work. In terms of font, I have decided to use sans serif “sans-serifs are to be used in digital works. This is because sans-serif fonts are easier to read online.” This ties in with the accessibility but also is to add the professional aspect to my website.</p>

            <h3>Colour Theory</h3>
            <p>I decided to contrast a darker cooler purple consistently, giving a serene, calming and mysterious aspect to this website. I wanted to establish these moods and feelings through the colour scheme as this compliments not only the pictures I have used but the overall mood I wanted to establish when creating my website beforehand. The use of purple on my website is also contrasted by the use of darker blues for the menu and white for the backgrounds, this helps create a professional look for my website along with allowing each section to be defined clearly. The use of Purple even though it is a secondary colour may be a niche choice compared to other websites that use bold primary colours attracting the viewers eye, though I decided to use this colour as not only does it help set the mood but compliments my images of graffiti. “people decide whether or not they like a product in 90 seconds or less and that 90% of that decision is solely based on colour.” This is why I decided to use my colour scheme as purple, it not only looks attractive and works well with my website but also adds brand recognition.</p>

            <h3>Accessibility</h3>
            <p>The way the website can be accessed and navigated is important for any viewers so they can absorb all the information that is intended for them. I feel the five linked pages are well placed to do so and are set out well to allow for the best accessibility possible. Another way I have addressed accessibility issues is to add ‘ALT’ text for visually impaired viewers as to allow them the same experience as everyone else.   “The most significant benefit of having ALT text on your images is accessibility…it helps provide a better user experience to visually impaired online users.” The use of alternative text also allows for my website to appear professional and therefore more attractive for everyone. The colour pallete I have used also affects the accessibility as the contrasts allow for separation between specific areas of my website whereas if I chose colours that didn’t contrast it would be harder for the viewers to take away the information I want, I have also made this possible through legible and clear fonts of Noto Sans.</p>

            <p>Throughout my pictures I tried using a range of different angles to add another dimension to the images and to create more of an emotional engagement with my website “How you choose to photograph your subject, your choice of lens, and where you choose to put yourself in relation to the scene, are factors that can change everything about an image. (Alexa Keefe 2016)” I used canted, lower and medium shots to create these emotional responses with the audience. I decided to also take my pictures with a darker set of lighting to help create a darker mood for my audience to understand the undertones and the meaning of the graffiti especially the mural. When taking the photos, I decided to use a DSLR camera for the high quality compared to my phone. When deciding how I would shoot my pictures I decided to not use a shutter speed shot as it wouldn’t work with the style I wanted to deploy on my website. Also when taking my images, I used a white balance to ensure the lighting was not too bright and it wouldn’t therefore affect the image quality.</p>


            <h2 class="section-heading">Social Media Formats</h2>

            <p>The videos we recorded for social media and the video we recorded for MOTDx were contrasting when it came to not only creating at the time but during editing. The formats of social media meant we had to edit the video from the original format to a portrait shot, this meant we also had to move the positioning of the camera to make sure there was no dead space and we caught everything we needed. The broadcast video however was pretty straightforward and simple to edit with only lighting and transitions needing to be changed. Though it was challenging for the editing when converting our social media video into portrait it was definitely needed because social media is important when marketing a video. “When it comes to drive more customers to a business, brand recognition is a significant element to consider. And this further justifies that why is social media important for business. A strong social media presence gives a voice to your brand. The social channels (Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, G+, Instagram etc.) give you an opportunity to establish your business as a prominent brand by keeping a meaningful relationship with consumers in real-time (Patti Neumann 2017).”</p>


            <h2 class="section-heading">Video Basics</h2>



            <p>The lighting in the video was a vibrant light, this helped create the vibrant and happy atmosphere for the audience watching. We had to edit the lighting however through adobe due to lighting being too bright as to not affect the quality of the image recorded and to keep the professional view. We also decided to add a graphic at the top corner of the screen to again appear professional as we added the BBC logo. The equipment usage also helped create the fast paced yet cleverly created piece of work through the use of good tech with a good camera and microphone for the best audio. The composition of our video recordings were calculated beforehand to help create the most realistic suitable environments especially when recording the football content, so choosing a football shirt shop, Old Trafford and the mural of Marcus Rashford were the perfect ways to portray our video. “Every time we see a beautiful photo, we will be attracted by its theme, its colour and its composition, whether you realize it or not(unknown, 2018).” The necessity for a perfect composition was crucial especially with the locations we had available to us.</p>
